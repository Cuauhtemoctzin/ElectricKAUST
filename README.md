This repository contains the code, analysis, and models for the [Electricity Load Forecasting Technology Contest 2017](https://cuusoo.com/projects/50136). This challenge is organized to discover innovative methods and new approaches in predicting electricity load with high accuracy.

## Electricity Load Forecasting Technology Contest 2017
This challenge is broken down into two phases:
  * Phase 1 - develop a model that forecasts hourly electricity demand on the following date by using the test data provided by TEPCO
  * Phase 2 - apply the developed model to the past 365 days electricity demand data of TEPCO's power grid and do the competition
